Satori's mission is to give the developer more power over his data, that's why we plan offering a complete suite of AI capabilities built-in with satori, to start using our AI capabilities run satori with this command

```bash
satori -ai
```

This will download a `~100MB`  model.

## AI Operations

At the present moment, Satori only supports Natural Language Querys as AI capability. You can make the GET operation by just writing some text, the request should look like this.

<ParamField body="query" type="string">
  Describe which objects you want to get by using natural language.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="top_k" type="int">
  If specified you will receive the top K best matches
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="similarity" type="float">
  Satori uses cosine similarity, if you specify this field only the objects that have the specified similarity will be considered similar (if top_k is specified the top_k objects with that specified simlarity will be returned), similarity should be a value between `0.0-1.0` being `1.0` totally equal.
</ParamField>
