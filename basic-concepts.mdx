# Satori

Control over your data doesn't have to be hard. Satori aims to give the developer superpowers without making it hard.

## Installing

1. First, download

   ### Linux

   ```bash
   curl www.satoridb.com/download/linux
   ```

   ### Windows

   ```bash
   curl www.satoridb.com/download/win
   ```
2. Then run satori

   ```bash
   satori -a root admin
   ```

## Arguments

You can run Satori with multiple arguments, this are

```bash
-p //set the port where satori will be executing (defaults to 2310)
-h //activate hyper cache
-m //connect to a network
-pwd //set network password
-ai //run satori with ai capabilities (a ~100mb model will be downloaded)
-a <username> <password> //enable authentication and set root user
-mem //use satori as a memory-only database
```

## Objects

Objects are the only data type in Satori and these are polymorphic, these can be a node, a JSON object, a string entry or all at once. Satori allows interactions among objects without caring about their kind. All functions are avaible to all Objects. All objects have the following fields and they must be specified when an object is created **(only if you're working directly with websockets and not with the sdks)**

<ParamField body="key" type="string">
  A key for accessing the object, if not provied, an uuid will be generated
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="data" type="string, json, number, any[]" required>
  This is the body that will be associated to your key, this can be anything you want
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="vertices" type="string[]">
  This array relates your object with other nodes, relations can be keys to object or just strings with any other meaning.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="type" type="string">
  This is used to order your data by classes like users, posts, etc...
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="expires" type="bool">
  If the objects expires it must be set to true
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="expiration_time" type="number">
  The time in milliseconds that the object must live
</ParamField>

## Operations

Operations or commands are the querys you make to the database, these are simple commands such as `SET, GET, PUT, DELETE`. Data operations modify the objects in the database and system operations modify the behavior of the system

## Users

When authentication is enabled, users are the only ones who can access the database, they can have roles that limit their capacity to access and modify the data, all users must have:

<ParamField body="username" type="string" required>
  
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="password" type="string">
  
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="permissions" type="number">
  `R || W || RW`
</ParamField>

### References

References are strings that point to an specific object, an example of this is an email that points to an user

`test@gmail.com -> Object(test_username)`

### Network Password

Is encouraged to set a network password in order to ensure a secure communication among all nodes without security flaws. All nodes in the same network must have the same network password, read all about descentralization below
